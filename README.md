# Getting and Cleaning Data Project's README
============================================
The purpose of this file is walking the reader throguh the script *run_analysis.R*, so that he/she understands how it works. The details about the variables can be found at the codebook, also provided in this repo. 

The script has the following six sections:
1. Importing and merging all the data sets
2. Extracting only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation
3. Renaming the activities with descriptive names
4. Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Creating an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
