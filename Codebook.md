# Codebook

This codebook explains in detail all the variables in the tidy data set which is the output of the script *run_analysis.R* (in my script this data set is called *dataDTmeans*). It is structured in the following way: for each variable its name is provided, together with its type of data, the units in which it is measured and its range of values. Finally, the origin variable in the original data of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" experiment is also detailed, in order to give full traceability. The original data description can be found here:
